Underbar
==============

I rewrote the following Underscore functions to better understand closures and higher order functions:

- first
- last
- each
- indexOf
- filter
- reject
- uniq
- map
- pluck
- reduce
- contains
- every
- some
- extend
- defaults
- once
- memoize
- delay
- shuffle
- invoke
- sortBy
- zip
- flatten
- intersection
- difference
- throttle

### Testing

Tests are located in the /spec directory. To run them, open the spec runner file in any browser.
